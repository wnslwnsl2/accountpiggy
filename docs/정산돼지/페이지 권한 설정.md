# 페이지 권한 설정

### Page Permission setting

admin 을 그룹으로 해서 권한을 주는 것 vs admin인지 아닌지 판단해서 사용하는 것



TODO

1) login required

2) ismember

3) isadmin > it couldn't cause admin is for each room's so we need to used manytomany relations ship with member



1) first have to set login required

- using @login_required



pages that needed to set

- RoomCreateView
- RoomSearchPage
- RoomReceptionPage
- and so on



Settings.LOGIN_URL

LoginMixin Mean?



## 2) is member

make decorator



### 3) permission?

make decorator~~!!



Good
